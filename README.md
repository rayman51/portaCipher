Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology studying 
Software Development

In this repository you will find a project I was asked to complete  
during second year.

The project was to create a porta cipher program. This program will parse in a text file or a url and ask the user to enter a keyword.
This keyword was then used to encrpyt the file and output to a newly created file.
This keyword was then again used to decrypt the file or url.

In the folder there is another readMe file showing you how to run the program and also a small user manaual.
